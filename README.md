# anls A Necessary Loot System
New loot system client application for World of Warcraft horde guild A Necessary Evil on EU-Hellfire.


Todo: 
* Implement "Bonus" event
* Implement player administration
* Implement instance administration
* Implement item administration
* Change header so a directive is used (reuse header code instead of copy-paste)
* Consider using restangular (https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) instead of $resource
* Add form validation for add item to player dialog.
* (Tempoarily) save order bys and event filters

Known bugs:


Done todos:
* Filter items based on instance in raid adm
* Color playernames according to class
* Remove refresh-delay after updates (when Tor changes server)
* Find a way to centralize load and manipulation of rest data more.
